# HW_Ntk_Security


The prime goal of this project is to implement a part of an intranet security solution. It
focuses on the implementation of an algorithm that will function in a way similar to network
mapping to detect the type and version of operating systems running on terminal devices
where the Raspberry Pi will be used to run the python script which will be responsible for the
detection via packet analysis, port scanning, port filtering, and based on predefined peculiar
attributes of operating systems. For the sake of simplicity the implementation test, all the
terminals and the Raspberry will be placed in the same subnet.

The program was adopted from other classes
